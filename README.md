# d0ppelganger
d0ppelganger is a url masking tool that can make a fishy url look like it's from a well known domain.  The purpose of making this tool is not to promote phishing. Rather it's about learnig how it works and spoting a phishing url right away if it's using url masking.

## Usage/Examples
1. clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Itsmmdoha/d0ppelganger
```
2. change directory
```bash
cd d0ppelganger
```
3. install dependencies
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
4. run the main file
```bash
python3 main.py
```

# How and why it works
![Screenshot from 2023-07-31 16-15-05](https://github.com/Itsmmdoha/d0ppelganger/assets/70005698/aa5760d6-8f56-4918-82ff-a6a460b22589)

The above diagram explaines the things this tool does to a url. 

## How it Works

URL masking is a technique used to make a link's destination appear different from its actual target. d0ppelganger utilizes the is.gd API to achieve this functionality. The "@ sign" is employed to manipulate the URL and trick the browser into ignoring the text before the "@" sign. 

In the past, the "username:password@site.com" pattern was commonly used to embed login credentials directly into the URL. 
Back in the day, if you typed "username:password@site.com" the browser would've translated it into a HTTP request like this:
```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: site.com
Authorization: Basic dXNlcm5hbWU6cGFzc3dvcmQ=
```
In this example, the username is "username" and the password is "password". The Authorization header contains the Base64-encoded representation of the credentials in the format "username:password". This method of embedding credentials directly in the URL is known as "Basic Authentication".

However, this method was inherently insecure and posed a security risk since the credentials would be exposed in server logs and could be easily accessed by unauthorized individuals. Due to these security concerns, modern browsers have deprecated and removed support for this syntax.
In modern browsers, the credentials part "username:password@" is simply ignored. The browser will instead make a regular HTTP request to the host specified in the URL without including the credentials. The request would look like this:
```http
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: site.com
```


## This tool uses the is.gd API

To know more about the api, refer to the [is.gd API Reference](https://is.gd/apishorteningreference.php).
By leveraging the is.gd API, d0ppelganger can shorten URLs, thereby making them look more trustworthy. However, it's crucial to note that such behavior can be misused for malicious purposes like phishing. The intention behind d0ppelganger is to raise awareness about URL masking and help users recognize and avoid potential phishing attacks.
